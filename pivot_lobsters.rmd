```{r}
### attach libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr) # install.packages('skimr')
library(kableExtra) # install.packages('kableExtra')

### read in data, and skip 4 rows
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters.xlsx"), skip = 4 )

### summary gives you only for numeric, not helpful when i have character so we use skim
skim(lobsters)

### %>% means to chain steps together
### function n() means count the number of times an observation shows up
### count the lobsters by year =, so we group by year and count 
lobsters %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count_by_year = n())

### single summary by 1*1
lobsters %>%
  summarise(count = n())
  
lobsters %>% 
  group_by(year)

### 6.4.2 group_by multiple variables
lobsters %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarise(county_by_siteyear = n())

### 6.4.3 summarize multiple variables
###### na.rm=TRUE means drop NA, so it can calculate without showing NA
siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarise(county_by_siteyear = n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
            )
### 6.4.4 Table formatting with kable()
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()


siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarise(county_by_siteyear = n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
            )

ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = county_by_siteyear, color = site)) + 
  geom_line()

ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))

ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x= year, y = median_size_mm)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~site)

ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-col.png"))

## read in correct data
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data/lobsters2.xlsx"), skip=4)

siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_siteyear =  n(), 
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), )

siteyear_summary

## a ggplot option:
ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site)) +
  geom_line() 

ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))

## another option:
ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~site)

ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-col.png"))

lobsters %>%
  count(site, year)

lobsters %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```      
### use backtick r ... backtick makes R code in-line in RMarkdown
There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report.
There are `r count(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this summary.
